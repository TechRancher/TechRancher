I am the coding Rancher :cow:  
Hobby coder is what I am. I enjoy learning new code languages and making fun projects when I can. Have a look partner at my <a href="https://github.com/TechRancher?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer tag me" title="My Cool Projects!">projects</a> and tell me if you are a fan.

## What I am Interested in

Being a former Rancher I have found areas that would make Rancher's lives a little easier. I am trying to get a better idea of coding to be able to build some of my ideas. I have spend some time learning these different languages along my trail.

### Here are the Languages I have learned:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScrip
* Python
  * Django
    * DjangoREST
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
* LUA
* C++
* Type Script

### Languages in the process of learning

* CPython - with C++
* Docker + Kubernets\-K8

### I would like to become more proficient in

* Python
  * CPython
  * Django + Docker
* C++
* LUA
* DayTrading ðŸ’² ðŸ’² ðŸ’²

### My Weakness

Web Design to me is like roping the moon ðŸŒ•. It just can't be done. But I am good at copying design ideas from others, but who likes to wear hand-me-down old :boot: :cowboy_hat_face:

### My Strengths

Backend with Django/DjangoREST is where I belong. I seem to thrive in the Python world. I want to grow deeper into the workings of the Django framework world with adding C++ connection to work with IoT world.

### My Long Term Goals

I would like to gain a better understanding of coding for microprocessors and get into IoT with the use of Django framework as my UI and Python as the backend. There is an opportunity to relieve pain points for ranchers by the use of technology and with these younger generation folks understanding the benefit of IoT the sky is the limits so to say.

### In My Spare Time

I am getting into writing scripts for Thinkorswim:registered: platform By: TD-Ameritrade. I have been studing on DayTrading for some time and have written some scripts to help detect trends and buy/sell indicators for the Bollinger Band indicator. Feel free to check them out in my <a href="https://github.com/TechRancher?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer tag me" title="Check out my hard work!">projects</a> page.

#### Always looking for partners to team up with

I would like to help with some IoT project if they did not mind that I am still a green hand about electronic coding.
