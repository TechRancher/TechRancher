**TechRancher** :bearded_person: is my username

I am the coding Rancher :cow:  
Hobby coder is what I am. I enjoy learning new code languages and making fun projects when I can. Have a look partner at my <a href="https://github.com/TechRancher?tab=repositories" target="_blank">projects</a> and tell me if you are a fan.  
I also enjoy Landscape Photography. You can see my photos at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sikesphotos/" target= "_blank"> Instagram Profile </a>.

## What I am Interested in

Being a former Rancher I have found areas that would make Rancher's lives a little easier. I am trying to get a better idea of coding to be able to build some of my ideas. I have spend some time learning these different languages along my trail.

### Here are the Languages I have learned:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScrip
* Python
  * Django
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
* LUA
* C++

### Languages in the process of learning:

* CPython - with C++
* Docker + Kubernets\-K8

### I would like to become more proficient in:

* Python
  * CPython
  * Django + Docker
* C++
* LUA

### My weakness are:

Web Design to me is like roping the moon. It just can't be done. But I am good at copying design ideas from others, but who likes to wear hand-me-down old :boot: :cowboy_hat_face:

### My Long Term Goals:

I would like to gain a better understanding of coding for microprocessors and get into IoT. There is an opportunity to relieve pain points for ranchers by the use of technology and with these younger generation folks understanding the benefit of IoT the sky is the limits so to say.

#### Always looking for partners to team up with

I would like to help with some IoT project if they did not mind that I am still a green hand about electronic coding.
