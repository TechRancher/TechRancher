**TechRancher** :bearded_person: is my username

I am the coding Rancher :cow:  
Hobby coder is what I am. I enjoy learning new code languages and making fun projects when I can. Have a look partner at my <a href="https://github.com/TechRancher?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="tag me" title="My Cool Projects!">projects</a> and tell me if you are a fan.

## What I am Interested in

Being a former Rancher I have found areas that would make Rancher's lives a little easier. I am trying to get a better idea of coding and electronics to be able to build some of my ideas. I have spent some time learning these different languages along my trail.

### Here are the Languages I have learned:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScrip
* Python
  * Django
    * DjangoREST
  * Kivy
    * KivyMD
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
* LUA
* C++
* TypeScript

### Languages in the process of learning

* MicroPython

### I would like to become more proficient in

* Python
  * CPython
  * Django + Docker
  * KivyMD
* C++
* LUA
* DayTrading ðŸ’² ðŸ’² ðŸ’²

### My Weakness

Web Design to me is like roping the moon ðŸŒ•. It just can't be done. I am good at copying design ideas from others, but who likes to wear hand-me-down old :boot: :cowboy_hat_face:

### My Strengths

The Agriculture IoT world is where I belong. I thrive in wanting to help Ag Startups by making a change in the digital world. I want to grow deeper into the workings of making Apps with KivyMD for new startups that are working with IoT for the Agriculture world.

### My Long Term Goals

I want to gain a better understanding of coding for microprocessors and get into IoT with the use of the KivyMD framework as my UI and Python as the backend. There is an opportunity to relieve pain points for ranchers through the use of technology and with these younger generation folks understanding the benefit of IoT the sky is the limit so to speak.

### In My Spare Time

I enjoy leather work. I like to make leather gun holsters, knife sheaths, and toolbelts.

#### Always looking for partners to team up with

I would like to help with some IoT projects making KivyMD apps that would work with their IC and Database, if they do not mind that I am still a green hand about how to build electronics.
